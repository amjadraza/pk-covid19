# Contributing To This Project

Pre-requisite to contributing is familiarity with Jupyter notebooks, markdown scripting language, Git and fastpages.

> happy to provide guidlines for keen contributors

We highly encourage contributions to this project and welcome PRs.

Familiarity with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) is helpful.  All you need to do is include the appropriate front matter in your notebook.  See [this guide](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#customizing-blog-posts-with-front-matter).

You can develop notebooks in google colab.

**A good pull request is highly encouraged ** - study the Jupyter notebook closely, especially the first cell that specifies the metadata, and how cells are hidden with `#hide` or `#hide_input`.

You should preview your dashboard locally by following [the Development Guide](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages/blob/master/_fastpages_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md), before submitting a PR.

# Guidelines For New Dashboards

- Your dashboard should not duplicate or present substantially the same information to what already exists in other dashboards.
- Any technical information and notes should go in an appendix.
- Make the visualization as approachable as possible.  Explain things in plain english.  Font sizes should be easy to read.
- Put your main visualization at the top of your notebook.  The methodology or "how to" should either be in footnotes or hidden from view.

# Guidelines for Post/Blogs

- Reference the data and literature properly

# Guidelines for Adding Resources

- Add the important links to resources
